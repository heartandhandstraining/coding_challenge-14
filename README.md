# coding_challenge-14

This coding challenge is all about **understanding javascript and coding without the help of a library or tool**. It is very easy to get caught up in all of the trendy libraries and tools that allow you to build front end applications. However, by focusing on just a library, you are letting yourself be at the mercy of trends that constantly change. Instead, if you are able to understand the core concepts of javascript, then you aren't as influenced by trends and you can constantly adapt since the underlying language of the web doesn't change very often (these libraries are all written in Javascript afterall!) In this challenge, you are only allowed to use JavaScript to build a game!

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel on Discord to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted websites on here.

## What is the Challenge?
Using this as an example (but don't copy the code or use jQuery): https://codepen.io/natewiley/pen/HBrbL, you have to build a matching game that has these features:
- Time elapsed until you complete the game (all cards revealed)
- Total Moves count before you complete the game
- Reset button to start the game over

You can use whatever template you want, but I recommend using the **Animal Emoji layout** that we build in the The Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery course in the **CSS Layout and CSS Grid Section**

Optional:
- High Score Leaderboard

This is how the game board should look like (but you can design it however you like):

**In an upcoming challenge we are going to be doing something really interesting where we turn what you create here into a multiplayer game... but that will come later in a future coding challenge."**

## Coding Challenge Submissions
The wonderful submissions from some of the Zero-to-Mastery students on the foutreenth coding challenge will be posted here at the end of the month!

## The Rules Are:

1. Use only HTML, CSS and Javascript create a web based matching game as shown above. Think about code efficiency, and readability of your code. 

2. **You have until February 28th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding-challenge Discord channel with the following message: "-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"
The bot will listen for the command and will submit the link you provided in the command. Please check that the bot responded with "Thanks for submitting your coding challenge entry!" and then double check the details it provides. We will compile all submissions here at the end of the month.

3. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
